			<h4>GlOBAL WARMING IN BOSTON</h4>
			<b href=""><h3>State of Boston Harbor Report</b></</h3>
			<p>The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) began the Boston Harbor Project in 1986. It consisted of a decade of environmental monitoring and collection of data that show dramatic changes in the Boston Harbor’s water. Samples of sediment, animals and water where taken. Nutrient and oxygen levels measured, all in attempt to measure water quality and health. The Boston Harbor was ranked one of the most polluted places. Due to high levels of turbidity an unnatural abundance of nutrients and pollution the nature was being altered. Marine life was decreasing or adapting and showing high levels of toxicity. The pollution was not only harmful to marine life but to humans. The water became an undrinkable source of water and health issues where appearing even if the only contact one had was swimming. “The project marked improvements in effluent discharges” especially after “MWRA upgraded disinfection and primary treatment and then added secondary treatment.” They also “increased enforcement of pretreatment of industrial wastewater, significantly reducing amounts of metals and other pollutants while minimizing the impacts of sewage by improving treatment and changing the location of effluent discharges.” Because of this project no treatment plants are discharging directly into the harbor today. 
<br><br>
The remaining pollution entering the harbor comes mainly from its tributary rivers. Changes that have been measured that indicate recovery are past and current measurements of bacteria, water clarity, nutrients, dissolved oxygen, toxic contaminants, and other indicators. 
<br><br>
Bacteria levels indicate public risk and they have been falling. Water quality reflects the complexity of the coastline. The causes of variations in water quality are not obvious. Water clarity determines how much light reaches the plants in the water and affects the ecosystem. In recent years clarity has improved indicating that the ecosystem could return to its natural state. The abnormally high nutrient levels (especially nitrogen) that can stimulate the overgrowth of phytoplankton and seaweed, have decreased. Today algae levels are back to natural levels. Dissolved oxygen, another measure of the harbors health has remained at healthy levels. The sediments where also measured and showed that there was less “organic matter settling on the harbor floor, and the sediments are more oxygenate.” Sediment contamination has decreased. The sediment metabolism that was measured, measures the effect of organic matter on the floor.  This shows level of pollution by indicating effects on marine life as well as indicating oxygen levels and the presence of organic matter. It is important to keep our waters clean to be able to have a healthy water and food source. The project finished in 2008 and cleaned the Harbor; now other sources of pollution must be dealt with.
