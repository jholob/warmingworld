			<h4>HOW TO CAPITALIZE ON CLIMATE CHANGE</h4>
			<b href="https://nexusmedianews.com/investors-bet-on-climate-to-make-big-bucks-7e46211df50a "><h3>Investors Bet on Bad Weather</b></</h3>
			<p>IBM’s new ad campaign features a jumble of corporate jargon—there are boasts of “a cloud platform built enterprise-strong” — next to a multiethnic array of models, each meant to represent a particular profession. A banker tops the page. Next to his face, it reads, “I can turn weather and tweets into high-yield returns.” IBM computers can sort through data — from tweets to temperature readings — to help investors make decisions. The ad speaks to the promise of computing technology, but it alludes to something murkier.
		<br><br>
			In the age of climate change, businesses and investors are looking for ways to turn a profit on bad weather.
	
			There is a mountain of research detailing the ways climate change will stunt the economy. A recent study details how rising temperatures will slowly chip away at the U.S. gross domestic product. But, a crisis for some is an opportunity for others.
		<br><br>
			Shipping firms are looking to vanishing sea ice to open up Arctic passageways, and mining companies are exploring for minerals in parts of Greenland uncovered by melting. Defense contractors see instability in vulnerable regions as an opportunity to sell “military products and services.” Pharmaceutical companies expect rising temperatures to fuel the spread of vector-borne diseases like malaria, increasing demand for mosquito nets and vaccines. Then, there are the companies buying up arable land and water rights, which will become more valuable as heat and drought stunt crop yields.
		<br><br>
			In the near-term, weather experts are looking for ways to use weather forecasts to make smart investments. David Titley, formerly the Navy’s chief oceanographer, teaches meteorology majors at Penn State to use weather and climate projections to advise business leaders on risks — and opportunities.
		<br><br>
			“Let’s say if I know it’s going to be a particularly high chance of a cold and snowy period — let’s say in Washington, DC — if I’m a Home Depot, I’ll probably want to bring in extra snowblowers, extra winter-type gear,” said Titley. “How do you think in terms of probabilities? And then, not only think in it, communicate it to your boss? Then, as we go forward, how do you do this in a changing climate?”

		<br><br>
			Titley, who has evangelized for climate action, believes businesses need to guard against climate risks. His students simulate trading in soybean and natural gas futures, two commodities affected by the weather. Drought and heat hurt crop yields, while warm weather drives down demand for natural gas, which is used to heat homes. Students learn that a savvy meteorologist can use her knowledge of weather to protect her business from climate shocks.
		<br><br>
			One way to do that is to invest in weather derivatives, which pay out when the weather turns ugly. At one time, it was farmers and energy companies who traded weather derivatives, but increasingly it’s hedge fund managers who are placing chips on tomorrow’s forecast. But, these investors aren’t trying to buy insurance against heat-induced crop failure. They are betting on the weather.
		<br><br>
			A few years ago, Wall Street firms were buying up weather derivatives that would pay out in the event of severe snowfall. Now, climate change is shifting weather patterns, producing milder winters and hotter summers. Instead of betting on snow, firms are betting on heat and rainfall. The future will likely see more of the same.
		<br><br>
			Wall Street has a history of gambling on bad outcomes. In the lead-up to the 2008 financial crisis, investors bought credit default swaps, which paid out when homeowners defaulted on their mortgage. Insurance giant AIG issued credit default swaps by the barrel. When the housing market collapsed, it had to pay out billions to investors. It’s conceivable that weather derivatives would produce a similar outcome. Betting big on weather and coming up short up could cripple investment firms, insurance companies or both.
		<br><br>
			In the age of climate change, it pays to be cautious, and it pays to understand the weather.
		<br><br>
			For a 2007 experiment, business students and meteorology students at Penn State made investments based on projections of the daily high and low temperature in different U.S. cities. Predictably, meteorology majors fared far better than business majors.
		<br><br>
			As Titley explained, “I could go to a business school and say, ‘Hey, you guys are really going to have to start understanding not only the statistics of weather, but the changing statistics of climate to be effective.’”

			<h4>THE PARIS CLIMATE TALKS: YES OUI CAN!</h4>
			<b href="https://www.newyorker.com/books"><h3>The world is waking up to the big financial risks of global warming</b></</h3>
		<p> This story was originally published by Newsweek and is reproduced here as part of the a school Climate Change collaboration project.
		<br><br>
A European and an American walk into their local bank. Each has a savings account. The banks have the same antiseptic feel, their cash machines make the same robotic moves. There is one fundamental difference between the two, however — how they account for the vulnerability of their assets to climate change.
		<br><br>
That’s a point that’s been made by a string of financial executives, regulators, and political figures over the past week of climate negotiations in Paris. That includes Mark Carney, head of the Bank of England, and Michael Bloomberg, former mayor of New York City, who have both called for a more uniform way to account for the huge, and accumulating, financial impacts of the warming planet in a way that will likely have rolling impacts across the global financial order far beyond the agreements reached here.
		<br><br>
Depending on which side of the Atlantic you’re on, the bank, or mutual fund, or any other investment vehicle run by a publicly traded company, will look quite differently at the spectrum of those climate risks. In France, for example, finance companies must provide the Financial Market Authority, or AMF (France’s version of the SEC) with its annual contribution to, and risk from, climate change. Physically a bank may have a small carbon footprint — composed primarily of the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions of the energy used in its offices. But its funds are another matter: As of this year, the AMF requires that banks also provide a detailed accounting of the exposure of its various investment funds to not only the physical risks from climate change but the risks of fossil fuels’ declining value as the shift towards renewables accelerates and the world moves toward limits on greenhouse gases. The French also require banks to report what the companies they invest their funds in are doing to help move toward and finance a low-carbon future.
		<br><br>
The French are the most rigorous, but some of their European counterparts are also taking the financial chaos threatened by climate change seriously. In Britain, disclosure laws require insurance companies to provide detailed rendering of their exposure to fossil fuel investments — which are increasingly being seen as highly risky by an array of authorities, from rating agencies to the Bank of England, which administers the British economy much like the Federal Reserve administers the American one. None of these factors are required to be reported to American investors by the SEC.
		<br><br>
“If you’re traded in France,” said Bevis Longstreth, a former commissioner with the SEC during the Clinton administration, earlier this year, “you have to show your carbon footprint. If you’re traded in New York, you don’t have to list anything, you can pretend you don’t even have a shadow.”
		<br><br>
That distinction between a shadow and a footprint is coming to be a significant focus within the financial community attending the climate talks in Paris this week. Concerns over the substantive financial risks that are accompanying the vast scale of natural disruptions wrought by climate change — $160 billion spent over the last several years to respond to extreme weather events in the U.S. alone, Secretary of State John Kerry announced in a speech Wednesday afternoon — are increasingly making their way into some of the world’s top financial institutions.
		<br><br>
Carbon Tracker, the U.K.-based NGO made up of former traders and economists analyzing climate risk, issued a report last week identifying a cascade of risks facing the coal and oil companies: significant increases in energy efficiency and miles per gallon in vehicles, technological innovations in energy storage and transmission, the plunging cost of renewable energy — the cost of solar power has dropped 80 percent since 2000 — and the increasing likelihood that governments, including those assembled at the Paris climate talks, will impose a price on carbon.
		<br><br>
At the Paris talks, the governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney (Britain’s equivalent of the chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve) announced the creation of a new “Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures” to assess the accuracy with which the G20’s financial markets reveal their vulnerability to climate risk. He asked the task force to assess the “stress points” in the financial system from climate risk, and appointed Bloomberg to run the effort. The two identified the tumult wrought by climate change as a potentially major destabilizing force on the global economy. Carney characterized the task force as an effort to rectify the current “market failure” to provide adequate information to investors about climate risks, and a significant step in the effort to “transition to a low carbon economy.”
		<br><br>
Carney’s initiative has its roots in the financial crisis that whipped across the U.S. and Europe in 2011, triggered largely by the previously unrecognized risks from mortgage derivatives and the collapsing housing markets. Following the crisis, the G20 created the Financial Stability Board to identify stresses in the global economy and head them off to avoid a repetition of the catastrophic cascade that triggered the Great Recession. Carney was appointed the chair just as climate change began creeping into the consciousness of financial professionals. In June, and then again in September, he warned that climate change presents a profound challenge to economic stability; then he required British insurance companies to provide detailed data on exposure of their funds to fossil fuel investments. Now, Carney’s concern has extended to the entire financial community — every major trading exchange will be included in the broad assessment of risks ahead.
		<br><br>
“He’s really been shaking things up,” says Sue Reid of Ceres, which has been meeting with the SEC over the past year in an effort to compel stricter climate disclosure standards for companies in the U.S. markets. “At the highest level, he’s telling the truth about the profound systemic and financial threat that carbon and climate present … Regulators don’t want to get caught asleep at the wheel like they were in 2011.”
		<br><br>
Investors are already starting to get the news; last week an international coalition of environmental and shareholder groups led by 350.org announced that 500 institutions with combined assets of $3.4 trillion had begun the process of withdrawing their investments from fossil fuels, the latest development in the effort to stigmatize the fuels that contribute to climate change. On Tuesday, two of the world’s biggest institutional investors, the German insurance giant Allianz and the Dutch pension fund giant ABP, announced that they would be divesting their portfolios of fossil fuels, largely based on the high risks they perceive in the future performance of that sector. Last spring, France’s largest insurance company, AXA, did the same. And the members of the Portfolio Decarbonization Coalition, an umbrella group of major companies, convened by the U.N. Environment Program, have committed to divest a total of $600 billion in assets from fossil fuels.
		<br><br>
So what does this mean for your pension or your investment funds? To get a sense of how the difference in disclosure policies on either side of the Atlantic translates into returns, I asked another banker: Zoe Knight, the managing director of Climate Change Research for HSBC Bank. Knight was also here in Paris, appearing on several panels to discuss how her bank, one of the world’s five largest, is advising investors how to think about the onrush of risks associated with fossil fuels. “It’s about risks and returns, and understanding bigger picture financial challenges triggered by climate change,” says Knight. “When an asset owner has to identify their carbon risk profile, it means you can assess the long-term viability of their investment. Climate disclosures allow you to make up your own mind.”
		<br><br>
In other words, there appears to be a growing risk of not disclosing your climate risk.
