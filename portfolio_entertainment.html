			<h4>MOVIE REVIEW</h4>
			<b href=""><h3>“The Big Thaw” Review</b></</h3>
			<p>Global Warming has raised much cause for alarm. Many areas where ice and snow are in abundance have suddenly seen shortages that could impact humanity more than just robbing them of a landscape. In Bolivia, high in the Andes the Chacaltaya ski area known as the highest ski area in the world (5,260 meters) is disappearing. When the area opened in 1939 the glacier was decreasing in size and since has quickened its pace. Artificial snow may replace snow for the ski resorts but it won’t replace the water supply lost.
<br><br>
“From the high mountains to the vast polar ice sheets, the world is losing its ice faster than anyone thought possible”1. Emissions from cars and industry are swiftly warming the earth resulting in an ice loss that will increase temperatures even more.  Glaciers and ice sheets are prone to feedbacks and when they melt the ice shrinks even more. The terrain exposed in many areas after some ice melts results in greater absorption of heat. These feedbacks can be seen all over the world and are shriveling glaciers ahead of time while breaking apart polar sheets that in turn go to the ocean. This increase in the disappearance of ice sheets and glaciers is resulting in an increase in our oceans water levels.
<br><br>
The disappearance of our glaciers could create catastrophic impacts in society. Forget the loss of ski areas when the decrease in water supply could stimulate war. Millions of people in countries like Peru, Bolivia, and India depend on melted water from mountain glaciers for irrigation, hydropower and drinking. If global warming continues unabated the supply of water in these and many other places will dry out not to mention that the coasts could drown. When Greenland and Antarctica see a greater impact on raising temperatures it is predicted that the rising sea could flood hundreds of thousands of square miles that include parts of Florida, Bangladesh, the Netherlands which will result in the displacement of tens of millions of people1. The loss of the glaciers will cause trouble all over the world and for now cities like La Paz, where mountain glaciers play a vital role as water banks, will face water shortages before the end of the decade as predicted by Edson Ramírez.
<br><br>
If there is continuing disregard for the changing climates in our world humanity will pass a point where there will be no turning back. It is urgent to drastically cut back on the use of greenhouse gases. The consumption of climate-warming oil, coal and gas must be reduced before the world spirals into a more unnatural climate cycle that the earth has not witnessed before. About 130,000 years ago before the latest ice age sea levels where higher. They had risen; much of the water that formed Greenland’s ice was part of the ocean. Natural changes in the earths tilt in space and its path around the sun increased temperatures to about 5° Celsius more than the temperature today. However, these changes in climate were a natural and today the rises in temperature are not due to earths positioning in space and its proximity to the sun. The ocean seems to be eroding the underside of the great floating ice. Today greenhouse gas emissions are causing earth to warm increasing water temperatures and melting ice, causing feedbacks that further increase the disappearance of glaciers.
<br><br>
“Steven Nerem of the University of Colorado at Boulder, who monitors sea level by satellite, says the oceans have been rising 0.3 centimeter a year.”1. Current studies and events from Antarctica and Greenland are reason to believe that by 2100 sea levels could rise one meter. The more the surface melts in the ice glaciers the faster the ice pile moves. The last time seas rose higher than today was 130,000 years ago, rising about six meters a rise caused by warmer oceans that triggered a partial collapse in the sheet. The only reason the great relic of the last ice age, Greenland, survived is because its mass allowed the island to create its own climate; perpetually covered in snow that reflecting light and heat. As the ice here shrinks its defenses will weaken and will speed up the melting process. Antarctica seems to be having similar effects and although there is little agreement to how much ice is being lost it could eventually result in a two-meter increase on the sea level. Each time the glaciers all over the world are more fragile and less resistant to climate fluctuations.

			<h4>MOVIE REVIEW</h4>
			<b href=""><h3>Movie review: The 11th Hour Success or Flop</b></</h3>
		<p>The film The 11th Hour explores how humanity lives and humanities impact on the earth’s ecosystem. The film explores possible solutions that can contribute to a healing ecofriendly future. Today the world has seen the highest record temperatures in history as well as an increase in droughts, famine, severe flooding. There has been record rainfall, hurricanes and an increase in acid rain. As short as man’s time has been on the earth it has not gone without notice. Humans impact on the earth are powerful and man’s drive to ensure its own survival and quality of life has revolutionized science, industry, medicine and nutrition. However, some changes have altered the delicate balance of nature and what makes life possible. It is the first time in history after a meteor hit the planet (55 million years ago) that nature has seen so many life forms gone extinct, there Is a “99.9999% species extinction rate”2. The rapid growth of human civilization after the industrial revolution has challenged nature and therefore man’s time on the earth unless our host is given rights and cared for.<br><br> Earth’s oceans and rainforests generate oxygen, absorb carbon dioxide, and govern climate, weather and temperature. The amount of natural greenhouse gases that enables life has been unnaturally increased from human waste. For every small production there is a greater number of waste produce this has poisoned our host. Oceans have been flooded with mercury, heavy metals, and toxic chemicals at the same time forests are disappearing, deserts are widening, and the arctic sea ice is melting. The earth is unnaturally growing warmer every year, reaching one of its highest points in history. As shown in the film, humanity has detached itself from nature and has been abusing and managing earth’s resources without concern. There has been an ongoing fight between human society and nature. The problem is nature is reacting and is currently affecting human life. Changes in earth’s climate increased catastrophes and famine and is creating a toxic unlivable host. Increasing health issues have quickened the concern for the environment “At least 30% of American children have asthma”2 A good balance is important since over history it has been proven that the environment and earth evolves. If the world doesn’t die which it might not seeing how it has adapted over the years we will? The environment will survive we might not. The planet is behaving like infected organism, the biosphere is in trouble and the environment is rapidly changing. It is imperative to create a sustainable future.<br><br>Over time we can see that anything left over from one animal or plant is food for another species, inefficiency doesn't last long in nature. And as the top of the food chain we should be contributing more than other species, truth is we don’t. “Humanity is currently using the renewable resources of 1.5 Earths to meet our yearly demands for energy, food, shelter, and the things we do and buy.”1 this pressure on nature is deteriorating our only home. There is an unnatural rapid way human society has grown and adapted and it’s time to take innovation to a more natural level. The way to create a sustainable future is by using nature as our inspiration while preserving it. Nature has taught man many valuable lessons and with the use of biomimicry man has made mind-blowing innovations such as Velcro. This approach to innovation, seeks sustainable solutions to human challenges by emulating nature's time-tested patterns and strategies. Makes it possible to create products, processes, and policies that will inspire a new way of living that is well-adapted to life on earth over the long run. Many innovations inspired by nature have made practical useful things. Now we must look to nature to create products that mimic nature’s ability to create and preserve life while maintaining a clean and functional environment that protects its host instead of damaging it. <br><br>Many climate change and environment solutions must be acquired through big corporate and government changes because they make a greater impact. There should be more environmental protection laws and restrictions on industries. Policies that government enforces to ensure businesses and corporations comply. People must place greater pressure on the government and on corporations to make this change happen. However, if the world united and every individual contributed to the decrease of the human footprint a greater and faster change would be achieved. The importance of individual contribution is the sustainability of the ecofriendly way. If everyone was to change their habits and raise the future in these new habits, our carbon emission will not persist as a problem. The first step to reduce our ecological footprint we must address the source of the biggest impact humans have on earth: energy use and eating. 
<br><br>Our actions must address the sources of the biggest impacts we humans have on our planet: energy use and eating. Without question, the most important thing we can do for our planet is to drastically reduce our CO2 emissions. To be able to reduce ones carbon footprint it is important that individuals get an idea of their own personal footprint. This way people will know what changes in their lives will cause a greater impact. Everything we do makes a demand on nature including the food we eat, what close we buy, where and how we move amongst other things. To be able to make a change, small changes are necessary. By using n energy efficient things we can reduce our footprint. By taking public transportation, car-pooling or a bike instead of your car it will be possible to avoid some pollutants. By choose the most environmentally friendly form of transport, driving less and avoiding short plane rides we can decrease carbon emissions. 
<br><br>
 Other daily habits must also be changed, when making decisions it’s important to choose the most eco-friendly option be it in household products appliances or simply reserving a hotel. People must become more informed and selective shoppers to choose the most ecofriendly options. It is important to save water by not letting water running and only doing full batches of laundry. It’s important to take short showers and save any form of paper especially by not flushing forests down the toilet. The mantra all individuals must learn to live by is “reduce, reuse and recycle”. Other simple changes includes changing light bulbs to fluorescents, a type of fluorescent lamp that uses less energy than a normal incandescent and unplugging all unused electronics. Another way to reduce transportation carbon emissions is to buy locally grown and produced foods. This will reduce the energy used to transport foods and products since the energy used to transport from all over the world is extremely high. 
<br><br>
It is important to stop deforestation and preserve these natural habitats, “In U.S. there’s been 90% deforestation”2.By planting more grass and trees that are used we are ensuring the sustainability of not only these species but also the products we make with them. This is a change that people can do individually and government must do by law. With new policies that restrict the abuse of resources many carbon emissions can be decreased and ecosystems saved. Businesses and communities must work together to minimize energy usage, water pollution and deforestation. If possible solar panels should be used amongst other self-sustaining energy sources that will not only stop the strain to our environment but will save money in the long run. Various methods must be used since “if we only relied on the Sun’s energy, the Earth could only sustain ½ Bill people”2 Many self-sustaining energy methods are expensive but since they are not an expensive monthly spending one can see monetary benefits in the long run as well. Government businesses and communities must start investing in ecofriendly appliances and habits as well as funding innovations that will make this process easier.
<br><br>
The next step to changing habits is to inspire youth. Educational programs and schools must stress the importance of the environment and its conservation. Schools must adopt ecofriendly habits such as recycling and reusing to be able to teach students how to live without creating a huge carbon footprint. There should be public awareness of this issue in schools newspapers and all social media while transforming the world to a harmonious balance of society and nature.
