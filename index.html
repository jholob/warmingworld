			<h4>GlOBAL WARMING IN BOSTON</h4>
			<b href="Images/boston.jpg"><h3>“Mapping The Harbors Recovery” Boston’s struggle to clean its waterways</b></</h3>
			<p>The Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) began the Boston Harbor Project in 1986. It consisted of a decade of environmental monitoring and collection of data that show dramatic changes in the Boston Harbor’s water. Samples of sediment, animals and water where taken. Nutrient and oxygen levels measured, all in attempt to measure water quality and health. The Boston Harbor was ranked one of the most polluted places. Due to high levels of turbidity an unnatural abundance of nutrients and pollution the nature was being altered. Marine life was decreasing or adapting and showing high levels of toxicity. The pollution was not only harmful to marine life but to humans. The water became an undrinkable source of water and health issues where appearing even if the only contact one had was swimming.  </p>

			<h4>ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE</h4>
			<b href="home_climate.html"><h3>All you need to know about weather and climate systems</b></</h3>
			<p>The climate system is composed of weather ad climate weather measures conditions in the atmosphere at any one time through radar and satellite images in real-time. It is relatively predictable and weather systems form and decay over periods of days to weeks. Climate is the average weather for a particular region over time. Climate becomes more stable with patterns over longer periods of time.

			The law of energy conservation implies that energy cannot be created nor destroyed it can only be transformed. The law of conservation of mass states that the total amount of mass remains constant in an isolated system in spite of any physical or chemical changes that may take place.

			Since certain amount of solar energy falls on Earth's surface (mass) at any given place and time, creating heat (energy). The laws of conservation of mass and energy apply. The earth warms because the same amount of heat energy that hits the earth is not dissipated back out into space. If more heat is re-radiated back out into space than is received, the planet would cool down.
