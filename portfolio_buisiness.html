			<p>From electric vehicles to renewable energy to LEED buildings, environmental innovation has driven transformations in industry after industry. These innovations promise rapid growth and insure profitable futures. And yet, the fossil fuel industry, the primary source of climate change, has failed to transform itself for the new reality. Why? Maybe financial innovation just doesn’t mix with environmentalism. Rather it’s the production side of capitalism, where innovation should happen.</p>

				<h3>Introducing EP, Greenometry’s Co2 measurement</b></</h3>
		<p>New Co2 measurement Created by Greenometry continues its fight for political recognition. But what is this measurement? 
			<br><br>
			Climate change is upon us. The problem is not people’s awareness of the current issue but the lack of action and measurable results. “The task is monumental. In order to remain below 2 degrees Celsius of global warming, emissions must be reduced by at least 20 percent by 2020 and 80 percent by 2050.” 2 Individuals know certain small-scale actions they can take to reduce their footprint, however the percentage of people who actually change their habits is too low. Now is not the time for minimal effort. To efficiently tackle climate change with current efforts, efforts would have had to start 50 years ago. We need bigger and better results. In the words of Peter Drucker “you can’t manage what you can’t measure”. Time is against us and until individuals can visualize and quantify their footprint, it will be too little progress too late. Solving the current climate crisis depends on the ability to transform our carbon intensive global economy to one that is carbon efficient.
